# StopWatch

Spigot plugin to handle all your timing related needs!

Planned:
* Admins: Repeating commands (Set a command to be run x amount of times, every x amount of minutes/hours)
* Admins: Command to kill all running timer-tasks in-case the plugin turns out to be a laggy mess
* Repeating interval reminders (Example: every 2 hours remind me to message Multicody10 to complain about my villagers)
* In-game timers
* life span timer - Get a read out of how long you were alive upon death/check current life span
* More

Todo:
* Add maxTime LocalTime and add checks for alarm and timer modes
* Update error messages, take a second loop at some of the condition flows
* Digital clock
* Permissions
* Config.myl - Editable prefix, sounds & alert alert message
* If possible, allow the following format to be valid: "5h20m30s"
