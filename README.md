# StopWatch

Spigot plugin to handle all your timing related needs!

Planned: 
* Alarm clock
* Digital clock (Display the servers current time and the minecraft world time in a bossbar, exp bar, title, scoreboard or something else)
* Admins: Repeating commands (Set a command to be run x amount of times, every x amount of minutes/hours)
* Admins: Command to kill all running timer-tasks in-case the plugin turns out to be a laggy mess 
* /stopwatch mode (Alarm/Timer/etc)
* Repeating interval reminders (Example: every 2 hours remind me to message Multicody10 to complain about my villagers)
* /playtime
* In-game timers. Signs possibly?
* More

Todo:
* Update argument logic to reflect new coming features
* Fix formatting issues
* If possible, allow the following format to be valid: "5h20m30s"
